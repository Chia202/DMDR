\title{Compute Kernel-Based Weights}
\usage{
cmptWeights(X, Y, mHat)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x p) of predictors, where each row represents an observation.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector (n) of response variable values.}

\item{mHat}{A numeric vector (n) of estimated mean values for each observation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector (n) of computed weights for each observation. Each weight is calculated as the
ratio of the kernel-weighted sum of squared residuals to the kernel-weighted sum of kernel values.
}
\description{
This function calculates observation weights using a kernel density estimation approach.
The weights reflect the kernel-weighted variance of residuals for each observation.
}
\details{
The function uses the following formula to compute weights for each observation \(k\):
\deqn{
  \widehat{w}(\mathbf{x}_k) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n K_h(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_k) \cdot (Y_i - \widehat{m}(\mathbf{x}_i^\mathrm{T} \boldsymbol{\alpha}))^2}
  {\sum_{i=1}^n K_h(\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{x}_k)}
}
Here, \(K_h\) represents the kernel function, which is assumed to be Gaussian in the implementation.

The computation is parallelized using OpenMP for improved performance on large datasets. Ensure your
environment supports OpenMP for optimal execution.
}
\note{
The kernel function used is Gaussian (\code{gaussianKernel}) and the weights are normalized by dividing by their sum.
