\title{Compute Projection Matrix}
\usage{
projection(B)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{A numeric matrix (\( m \times n \)), representing the basis of a subspace.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix (\( m \times m \)), which is the projection matrix \( P \):
\deqn{P = B (B^T B + \epsilon I)^{-1} B^T}
where \( \epsilon = 10^{-6} \) ensures numerical stability.
}
\description{
Calculates the projection matrix for a given matrix \( B \), which represents the subspace defined by \( B \).
}
\details{
The projection matrix \( P \) is computed using a regularized inverse to ensure stability when \( B^T B \) is near-singular.
This is useful for projecting vectors onto the subspace defined by the columns of \( B \).
}
\examples{
# Example in R
B <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 5)
P <- projection(B)
print(P)
