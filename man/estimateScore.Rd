\usage{
estimateScore(X, alpha, Y, h1, h2, h3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x p) of predictors, where each row corresponds to an observation and each column represents a predictor variable.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric matrix (p x d) of transformation coefficients used to project the predictor variables into a lower-dimensional space. The transformation is applied to each row of X.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector (n) of responses corresponding to each observation in X. This is the dependent variable in the regression.}

\item{h1}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for the regression kernel. This parameter controls the smoothing effect in the regression step, affecting how much weight is given to nearby observations during the local linear fitting.}

\item{h2}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for weight estimation kernel. This bandwidth is used in estimating the weighted averages of the responses, controlling the smoothness of the estimated weights.}

\item{h3}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for covariate adjustment kernel. It affects the kernel used to estimate the weighted averages of the predictors, determining how much influence nearby predictor values have on the estimation process.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{mHat}: A numeric vector of estimated intercepts from the local linear regression at each observation. This represents the estimated value of the response variable after transformation using the projection matrix \code{alpha}.
\item \code{m1Hat}: A numeric matrix of estimated slope coefficients. Each column corresponds to the slope coefficients associated with each predictor variable after projection, representing how each predictor affects the response variable in the transformed space.
\item \code{eWHat}: A numeric vector of weighted averages of responses, calculated using kernel density estimation. This is the conditional expectation of the responses, weighted by the kernel function based on the given bandwidth \code{h2}.
\item \code{exWHat}: A numeric matrix of weighted averages of the predictor variables, similarly estimated using kernel density functions for each predictor. It represents the conditional expectation of the predictors, weighted by the kernel function based on the bandwidth \code{h3}.
\item \code{scoreHat}: A numeric matrix of estimated scores for each observation. These scores are computed based on the weighted residuals from the local regression, adjusted by the estimated weights from \code{eWHat} and \code{exWHat}.
\item \code{eScore}: A numeric vector of mean scores, representing the average score across all observations, useful for model evaluation or assessment of overall fit.
\item \code{H}: A numeric matrix representing the Hessian of the model at each observation, used to estimate second-order partial derivatives of the loss function. This matrix is important for assessing the curvature of the model and is essential for optimization steps involving second-order methods.
