\usage{
estimateScoreSparse(X, alpha, Y, h1, h2, h3)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x p) of predictors, where each row corresponds to an observation and each column represents a predictor variable.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric matrix (p x d) of transformation coefficients used to project the predictor variables into a lower-dimensional space, incorporating sparsity constraints. This matrix ensures that many coefficients may be zero, enhancing interpretability.}

\item{Y}{A numeric vector (n) of responses corresponding to each observation in X. This is the dependent variable in the regression.}

\item{h1}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for the regression kernel. Controls the smoothing effect in the sparse regression step, determining the weight given to nearby observations.}

\item{h2}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for weight estimation kernel. Determines the smoothness of the estimated weights, incorporating sparsity in weighted averages of responses.}

\item{h3}{A numeric value representing the bandwidth parameter for covariate adjustment kernel. Controls the smoothness of the kernel used to estimate weighted averages of the predictors, ensuring sparsity in the estimation process.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{mHat}: A numeric vector of estimated intercepts from the sparse local regression at each observation. Represents the response variable after applying the sparse transformation matrix \code{alpha}.
\item \code{m1Hat}: A numeric matrix of estimated sparse slope coefficients. Each column corresponds to the slope coefficients associated with each predictor after projection, ensuring sparsity in the representation.
\item \code{eWHat}: A numeric vector of weighted averages of responses, calculated using sparse kernel density estimation. Represents the conditional expectation of the responses, weighted by the kernel function with sparsity regularization.
\item \code{exWHat}: A numeric matrix of weighted averages of the predictor variables, estimated using sparse kernel density functions. Represents the conditional expectation of predictors, incorporating sparsity constraints.
\item \code{scoreHat}: A numeric matrix of sparse scores for each observation, computed based on the residuals from sparse local regression, adjusted by the sparse weights from \code{eWHat} and \code{exWHat}.
\item \code{eScore}: A numeric vector of mean sparse scores, representing the average sparse score across observations. Useful for assessing overall model sparsity and fit.
\item \code{H}: A numeric matrix representing the sparse Hessian of the model at each observation. Captures the second-order partial derivatives of the loss function with sparsity constraints, essential for optimization steps involving second-order methods.

\description{
Implements the core algorithm for estimating scores and parameters with an emphasis on sparsity. This method incorporates sparsity-inducing techniques into the regression and kernel density estimation process.
}
\details{
The \code{estimateScoreSparse} function builds upon the \code{estimateScore} function by incorporating sparsity-inducing techniques. These techniques enforce zero coefficients in the transformation matrix \code{alpha} and ensure sparse representations in all estimation steps. The sparse solution is particularly beneficial for high-dimensional data where many predictors may be irrelevant.

Sparsity enhances model interpretability and reduces computational complexity while preserving essential information. The algorithm iteratively refines estimates using sparse kernels and ensures convergence through second-order optimization methods. The Hessian matrix is adjusted to account for sparsity in curvature assessments.
