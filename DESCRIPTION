Description: This package provides efficient methods for dimension reduction in large-scale data settings. It implements distributed semi-parametric approaches to reduce computational complexity while retaining accuracy. Core features include sparse and dense solutions for distributed mean dimension reduction, adaptive bandwidth selection, and integration with kernel-based regression techniques. The methods are particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets partitioned across multiple machines.
